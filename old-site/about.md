# Why a Computer Science group for women?

It is a widely known fact that men far outnumber women in the field of computer science. Simply step into any of the numerous computer science courses offered at Rutgers, and more likely than not, one will find that more than 80% of the students are male. Women in Computer Science (WCS) was created as a result of this gender gap, to encourage the participation of women in computer science as well as to help the women that are enrolled in computer courses and provide support. There are also many opportunities and resources specifically geared towards women, such as conferences, scholarships, and research, that Rutgers CS students should be aware of.

# Join Us

WCS is open to any students, male or female, at Rutgers interested in computer science and supportive of women in this field. As a member of WCS, you will be able to network with other computer science undergraduate students as well as computer science graduate students and faculty during our events throughout the year. Also, you will be alerted to opportunities such as scholarships, internships, research, job events, and more as they arise through our mailing list.
